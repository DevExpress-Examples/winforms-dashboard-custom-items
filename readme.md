# WinForms Dashboard - Custom Items

The following example shows how you can implement a custom dashboard item in a WinForms application.The custom item allows you to embed any WinForms UI control in a dashboard. You can interact with custom items in the Dashboard Designer just like with any built-in item.

This repository contains the following custom dashboard items that allow you to add the additional functionality to the WinForms Dashboard:

* [Sankey diagram](./CS/CustomItemSample/CustomItems/SankeyChart/readme.md)

    A Sankey diagram visualizes data as weighted flows or relationships between nodes. 
* [Sunburst](./CS/CustomItemSample/CustomItems/SunburstChart/readme.md)

    A Sunburst combines a TreeMap and a Pie chart to visualize hierarchical data in a circular layout. 
* [Waypoint map](./CS/CustomItemSample/CustomItems/WaypointMap/readme.md)
